-- A. Customer Journey

-- Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, 
-- write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
-- Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

SELECT * 
FROM subscriptions
JOIN plans USING(plan_id)
WHERE customer_id < 9;
-- FINDINGS
-- CUSTOMER 1: first started as trial user on 2020-08-01 and later switch to basic monthly after 7 days on 2020-08-08 and currently using the same plan.

-- CUSTOMER 2:  first started as trial user on 2020-08-01 and later switch to pro annual after 7 days on 2020-08-08 and currently using the same plan.


-- B. Data Analysis Questions

-- B1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
FROM subscriptions;

-- B2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value

SELECT * FROM plans;

SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM start_date) AS month, COUNT(customer_id) AS trail_plans
FROM subscriptions
WHERE plan_id = 0
GROUP BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM start_date)
ORDER BY month;

-- B3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name

SELECT plan_name, count(*)
FROM subscriptions
JOIN plans USING(plan_id)
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_date) > 2020
GROUP BY plan_name
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- B4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?

SELECT * FROM subscriptions;

-- B5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial
-- - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?

-- 6. What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?

-- 7. What is the customer count and percentage breakdown of all 5 plan_name values at 2020-12-31?

-- My approach: working smartly BUT just ignoring one edge case, for ex: where the customer subscribe for any period of time and 
-- churn it just before 2020-12-31. so my query will ignore that plan and customer but it will return the actual subscribed plan:(
